This repository develops support for reading the SEQ file format produced by the DynamiX laboratory, University of Sydney. The aim is to provide low level support to display and process the radiographs in as many softwares and languages as possible. 
It does not provides additional post-processing capabilities. If those are needed, please contact the relevent staff that will point you in the right direction. 

### Documentation
Documentations are provided in the individual README files in the folders specific to each software / language. 

### Installation
Each folder is independent, hence you may decide to download only the folder you are interested in. The installation and usage process depends on each particular software, please consult the relevent README file. 

### Testing
A sample file is provided at the root of this repository, as well as a gif displaying what the images should look like. Note that SEQ files must always be accompanied with a LOG files of the same name. Hence both the `Sample.seq` and `Sample.log` files are necessary in order to test the reader you are installing.  


_Insider note_ Support for Varian SEQ file format, as well as legacy log file format, has been removed for this repository.
